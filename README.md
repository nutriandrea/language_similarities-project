# language_similarities-project
This project focuses on analyzing the phonetic similarity between words in different languages. The script reads a TSV file containing words and their corresponding languages, transliterates the words into phonemes using the Epitran library, and calculates the similarity between pairs of words based on the Levenshtein distance.
